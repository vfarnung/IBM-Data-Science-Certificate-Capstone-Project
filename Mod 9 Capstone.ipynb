To me, it happens a lot of times that I am the mood for a certain cuisine but there are either no restaurants offering that option around or the ones present aren't as good as I hoped the would be. For that reason, I decided to use the Foursqaure location data to find out which neighboorhoods in New York are known for which cuisines, in particular which neighboorhoods have multiple outstanding restaurants of a particular cuisine. Addtionally, for the top three cuisines of a neighboorhood, I plan to offer a list of the top 5 restaurants for each"

Once I know the different neighboorhoods, I am going to use the Foursquare API to determine which venue categories are most popular in the different neighboorhoods and then create a list of the top 5 restaurants for the top 3 venue categories in each neighboorhood.
